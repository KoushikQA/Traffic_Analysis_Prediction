# Traffic_Analysis_Prediction #
Convert traffic dataset to a time series format and predict traffic flow at any junction.

The following steps were performed:

o	Conducted Data Preparation

o	Conducted Data Visualization

o	Scaled Data using Standardscaler

o	Created lagged data for time series analysis

o	Trained a RandomForestRegressor on lagged data

o	Successfully converted the dataset to a time series format and predicted traffic flow at junctions

o	Visualized and analyzed  traffic flow patterns effectively
